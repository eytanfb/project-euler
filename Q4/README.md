Question 4:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Notes:
I know this could have taken less time using Ruby or Python but again I am trying to work with as many technologies as I can.
